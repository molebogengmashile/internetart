       <h2>Blog 1: Internet Art</h2>
           <p>
           This is a critical analysis of Olia Lialina's internet artwork Online newspapers. The artwork consists of five newspapers
            from different parts of the world. The newspapers all have animated gifs spread-out throughout the pages. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
             paper has animated roses, the Daily Jang paper has colorful balls, the USA TODAY paper has American flags, the Wall Street Journal Europe 
             paper has different wild animals and lastly the Dajiyuan has street fighter characters on it.
            Right below the papers are links to the real online versions of these papers that exist yeaterday.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

          The artwork utilizes real physical objects to make art that is only accessible online. Olia has taken one form of art and new art in another 
          medium. Are the newspapers art? No, however, they have become a recorded part of history that has been transformed into art, internet art.
           In the article, The work of art in the age of the internet (2020), Carrier claims that an artwork that has been duplicated loses its aura 
           and thus does not have the same value as the original. The original newspapers might not even exist anymore, but they have been immortalized in Olia's work. 
           They have a historical significance to internet art. Their physical essence did not have any meaning, besides being sheets of paper with news printed all over them, until
            they were transformed to images and then to internet art. These papers have lost their initial aura as newspapers of a
           certain time period; however, they have gained a new one through what they have become and what they symbolize today.

           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The internet has the ability to act as an archive to historical digital artifacts, however, these old creations need to be modified to
           suit the current software, (O'Toole, 2019).  The links to the current online newspapers show the difference between the Online newspapers 
           artwork and the actual online newspapers. The actual online newspapers try to imitate physical newspapers with the way they are written and
            how the audience must read them. Olia's newspapers look identical to the physical ones with the animated gifs and digital medium being the
             only difference.The newspapers were all published in August 2004, from the 2nd to the 9th. According to onthisday.com, the only major events 
             to occur during that time were the deaths of American funk musician Rick James (6th of August), American composer David Raksin (9th of August),
              French politician and president of the European Court of Justice Robert Lecourt (9th of August), American jazz guitarist Tony Mottola (9th of August),
               American musician Don Tosti (2nd of August) and Belgian comic artist François Craenhals (2nd of August). The significance of the dates and to the artwork 
               is unknown and so are the countries in which the newspapers are from. "The web has an immense influence on our daily lives and the social relationships we construct,
           making undeniable the importance of internet culture and its associated internet creations." (Danae, 2019).  

           <br></br>
          <br></br>

          The animated gifs on each paper could be trying to undermine the newspapers or just be a mockery of the serious tone they have.
           They could also just reflect the artist's interests at the time. Maybe they represent the pop culture of the different countries during 
           that period. The reasons to why the artists made this artwork are unknown,
           this artwork is important because it reflects on a part of internet culture in history.

       <h2>Blog 2: Aesthetics in Web design </h2>
           <p>
           Usually, when people visit a website, they are looking for something. They have a reason for spending their time on the page. 
           The job of the web page is to help them find what they are looking for as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Whether it be the latest
            celeb goss, which coffee machine gets you the best coffee ever, or how to remove a suspicious red stain on a carpet, people will always turn
             to the internet for information, and they will probably find a website that can help.
            Whether or not they find what they are looking for can be greatly influenced by the aesthetics of the page. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          According to dictionary.com, an aesthetic refers to a philosophical theory or set of principles governing the idea of beauty at a given time
           and place.  Websites often rely on visuals to communicate to users. These visuals then create the aesthetic of the site. It is impossible for
            a website to not have an aesthetic as every website is trying to communicate information to the users. Visual communication happens in every text, picture, 
            video, color, or any other form of expression one can see on a screen (Thorlacius, 2007). The most important thing about these visuals is that they help the user find what
             they are there for. The site needs to communicate quickly and efficiently and therefore requires a balance between functionality and aesthetics to do so in the best way possible (Thorlacius, 2007).
              The functionality refers to how the
           user can move through the site and the aesthetics should allow the user to do so without confusion. 
           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          What is more important, functionality or aesthetics? Can one exist without the other on a webpage? Since aesthetics are automatically created
           whether a web developer has taken them into consideration or not, functionality does not exist without aesthetics. Even if a website's sole 
           purpose is to be pretty, it still requires functionality to some extent. It often seems as though the visuals on a page only exist to support
            the functionality. This is true to some extent, however, it really depends on what type of site it is and what information it is presenting
             (Thorlacius, 2007). For example,
           search sites such as google.com focus more on functionality to not distract the user from what they are looking for. 
           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Many sites follow conventions or trends with how they present their aesthetics. There are rules that designers follow that have become 
          standard on most sites as well. These rules can often determine whether a site is good or bad. The rules focus on the effectiveness of 
          the navigation, the use of color, and the overall layout of the page (Liu, 2018). Aesthetics can influence how we interact with a product. 
          Most people determine the value of something based on how it looks and how it is presented. They would rather have a more attractive product
           overall. This can be applied to websites as well (Nikolov, 2017).  
         A more attractive and effectively communicated site will often be chosen over others even when they sell the same product. It is the 
         overall user's experience on the site that designers must focus on in order to keep them coming back.  The sense of sight plays a major
          role in how people make decisions, and it would be in everyone's best interest if aesthetics on websites were taken a lot more seriously.

       <h2>Blog 3: The Internet, Society and Design Justice. </h2>
       <p>
       Since the dawn of time, humanity has thrived due to our ability to solve problems. From the wheel to electricity to the internet,
        we have come up with solutions to provide a better quality of life for ourselves. These solutions underwent a thorough design process
         to provide us with the best possible product,
        however, with every new solution, comes a new problem to solve. 
        <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Each technological advancement people have made has left a community (often a minority) excluded, this can be seen in the rise of the 
          internet and how it has created the digital divide. The digital divide is the gap of communication created between parts of the world 
          does use the internet as part of their daily lives, and the parts that don't, (Daniolou, 2020). These parts of the world are often places
           that have lower levels of education,
           lower incomes, and poor healthcare systems, (Daniolou, 2020). 
           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Often, designers aim to solve problems that affect themselves. Although it may not be possible to accommodate everyone with our current
           technology, it doesn't mean that those who have been excluded should stay silent.
